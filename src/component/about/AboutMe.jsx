                        Hii! I am <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Sushma Yadav</span>. Welcome to my page first of all. I would love to share my journey and how things are going right now.I currently live in India, a very beautiful country. I have done graduation (B.Tech) from Inderprastha Engineering College which is affiliated by Abdul Kalam Technical University(AKTU). In Web development for example, I master a wide range of technologies , from HTML , CSS , JavaScript here and there as well as libraries such as bootstrap , material UI and much more but mostly React Js with all its power. I'm a proficient front-end developer. In the past, I tried many work methodologies (always in the pursuit of efficiency) but occasionally got caught up in perfectionism, procrastination and over-planning. Currently, and being a passionate standardista, the work gets done in the best and most efficient way possible, always targeting high quality standards. My relationship with technology and software development has undergone numerous transformations. As an individual, I'm always looking for new challenges and researching for new advanced techniques is a constant. I'm achievement-oriented and like to push the boundaries more and more each time, always trying to stay at the fore front of cutting edge technology.
